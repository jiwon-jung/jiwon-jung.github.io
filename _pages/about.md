I am an Acting Instructor and Pearson Fellow in the Department of Applied Mathematics at the University of Washington, where I continue to develop my expertise in data science, time series analysis, and applied statistics. Previously, I was a Visiting Assistant Professor in the Department of Statistics at Purdue University.
I earned my Ph.D. in Statistics from Purdue University in 2024, where I was a member of the <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/purdue-dsfi/home" target="_blank"><b>Data Science in Finance and Industry</b></a> research group, advised by <a href="https://www.stat.purdue.edu/~kiseop/" target="_blank">Dr. Kiseop Lee</a> and <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/mxu/home?_ga=2.50296166.1710331856.1676529185-1031281822.1663908437" target="_blank">Dr. Mengyi Xu</a>. I hold a B.A. in Economics and Statistics and an M.S. in Statistics, both from Seoul National University.  

My research centers on data-driven methods in finance and insurance, complemented by applied experience in the medical and industrial sectors. From 2019 to 2020, I worked as a researcher at Asan Medical Center, applying statistical techniques to advance cancer imaging analysis. From 2022 to 2024, I served as a smart factory researcher at <a href="https://vivity.ai/" target="_blank"><b>Vivity AI</b></a>, leading data-driven projects that integrated academic research into manufacturing systems.
